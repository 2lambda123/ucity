The open-source city building game for Game Boy Color.

Introduction
============

This is a beta version of µCity (also spelled 'uCity', pronounced 'micro-city').
Some of the functionality is missing, but most of the game is completed.

It is developed using BGB (http://bgb.bircd.org/), and it's tested on hardware
every once in a while.

General to do list:

- Adjust simulation parameters
- Music
- Sample cities
- Improve graphics
- Cleanup code and document

Dependencies:

- RGBDS

  This game needs a really recent version of this toolchain to correctly
  assemble the code. It is the only real dependency:

      https://github.com/rednex/rgbds/

- GBT Player

  It uses GBT Player, my music player library. It is not needed to install it as
  it comes with the game code, but it can be found here if you want to use it
  for your projects:

      https://github.com/AntonioND/gbt-player


Tools (for Windows, but they run on Wine):

- GBTD (Game Boy Tile Designer) and GBMB (Game Boy Map Builder)

  Note that both of them can be found in this repository in case the following
  links are broken:

    http://www.devrs.com/gb/hmgd/gbmb.html
    http://www.devrs.com/gb/hmgd/gbtd.html

Compiling
=========

The Makefile has to be edited to point to the folder where the RGBDS binaries
are stored. Then, from the command line, type :code:`make`. This should work on
Linux, MinGW, Cygwin, etc. To remove all files that are generated by that
command, type :code:`make clean`.
